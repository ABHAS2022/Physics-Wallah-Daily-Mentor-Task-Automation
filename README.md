# Physics-Wallah-Daily-Mentor-Task-Automation

## Introduction

As a mentor at Physics Wallah, one of my key responsibilities was to send three questions daily to the assigned groups. To streamline this daily task, I developed an automation program using Selenium. This project automates the process of taking screenshots of questions from a designated folder, randomizing them, and then uploading them to the specified chat platforms. The project was created out of a desire to make a routine task more enjoyable and efficient.

## Features

- **Randomization**: Randomizes the order of questions to ensure variety.
- **Upload Automation**: Uploads the randomized questions to the designated chat platforms.
